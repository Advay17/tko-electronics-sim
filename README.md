# TKO 1351 Circuit Simulator
<!--- ![TKO 1351 Circuit Simulator](core/assets/img/circuitsim.png) --->

An FRC circuit simulator used by our electronics department for complex diagramming and training.


### Features

- 2D CAD-inspired GUI
- Creating, moving, editing devices and cables
- Saving/importing circuits as files
- Automated debugging for all errors
- Accurate circuit diagramming with FRC parts (see subsection below)
- Native, can be run cross-platform

### Future Updates

- complete LED simulation
- Accurate scaling of parts on a blocks-per-inch grid
- Timed competitive wiring games

### Installation

#### Releases

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko-electronics-sim/releases) page and download the binary for your platform. Directions for installation are also included there.

#### Gradle

1. Clone the repository using git
2. Run `gradlew build` and then `gradlew run` in a console in the top directory

If you use Linux/Mac OS, run `./gradlew build` and then `./gradlew run` in a console in the top directory. If it says permission denied, do `chmod +x gradlew`.
