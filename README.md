---

An FRC circuit simulator used by our electronics department for complex diagramming and training.

Created by [Rohan Bansal](https://github.com/Rohan-Bansal) and [Andy Li](https://github.com/AndyLi23).

### Features

- 2D CAD-inspired GUI
- Creating, moving, editing devices and cables
- Saving/importing circuits as files
- Automated debugging for all errors
- Partial LED simulation
- Accurate circuit diagramming with FRC parts (see subsection below)
- Native, can be run cross-platform

### Future Updates


- curved cables
- complete LED simulation
- accurate scaling of parts on a blocks-per-inch grid
- timed competitive wiring games
- color themes
- commented code

### Installation

#### Releases

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/MittyRobotics/tko-electronics-sim/releases) page and download the binary for your platform. Directions for installation are also included there.

#### Gradle
